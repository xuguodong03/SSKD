# SSKD
This repo is the implementation of paper Knowledge Distillation Meets Self-Supervision.

## Prerequisite
This repo is tested with Ubuntu 16.04.5, Python 3.7, PyTorch 1.5.0, CUDA 10.2.
Make sure to install pytorch, torchvision, tensorboardX, numpy before using this repo.

## Running

### Teacher Training
An example of teacher training is:
```
python teacher.py --arch wrn_40_2 --lr 0.05 --gpu-id 0
```
where you can specify the architecture via flag `--arch`

### Student Training
An example of student training is:
```
python student.py --t-path ./experiments/teacher_wrn_40_2_seed0/ --s-arch wrn_16_2 --lr 0.05 --gpu-id 0
```
The meanings of flags are:
> `--t-path`: teacher's checkpoint path. Automatically search the checkpoint containing 'best' keyword in its name.

> `--s-arch`: student's architecture.

All the commands can be found in `command.sh`
